# Media Library

Books-‘N-Stuff carries three different types of media: books, CDs, and movies. In this project you will create a parent class named Media with three subclasses: Book, Movie, and CD.

## Book

- Properties: author (string), title (string), pages (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty).
- Getters: all properties have a getter
- Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()

## Movie

- Properties: director (string), title (string), runTime (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty)
- Getters: all properties have a getter
- Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()

## CD

- Properties: artist (string), title (string), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty), songs (array of strings)
